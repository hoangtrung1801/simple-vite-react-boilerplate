# Linh Ung Pagoda Audio Guide

## Overview
Linh Ung Audio Guide is a web-based audio guide app designed for tourists visiting the Linh Ung Pagoda. The app automatically plays informative audio content as visitors walk around different locations within the pagoda, helping them learn about its history, culture, and significance.

## What Problem Does It Solve?
Traditional tour guides may not always be available, and reading long texts while exploring can be inconvenient. This app provides a hands-free audio experience that lets visitors enjoy the pagoda while learning about it at their own pace.

## How It Works
The app uses your phone's location to:
- Play the right audio content automatically when you reach specific spots
- Show your current position on an interactive map
- Guide you through the recommended tour path
- Work in Vietnamese and English languages
- Continue working even with poor internet connection
